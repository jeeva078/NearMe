    <p><font color="#0D47A1">Mettur Dam, located in<b>Salem district</b> of Tamil Nadu, is one of the <big>largest and oldest
     dams   in India</big>. Built across the <i>River Cauvery</i>, it was completed in <b>1934</b> and serves as a crucial
      irrigation and hydroelectric power source. The dam stands 120 feet tall and stretches 1,700 meters in length. It forms the
       Stanley Reservoir, which is a major water storage system in South India. Mettur Dam irrigates over 2.7 lakh hectares of 
       land in Tamil Naduâ€™s <b>delta districts</b>. It plays a vital role in regulating water flow during the monsoon season
        and helps manage floods. The surrounding area is rich in natural beauty, attracting tourists throughout the year
        . The dam also supports a hydroelectric power station, contributing to regional energy needs. It is a significant
         engineering marvel of pre-independence India. Mettur continues to be central to
